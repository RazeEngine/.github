Raze Engine is a cross-platform 2D and 3D game engine for development on desktop, console, and mobile. There are no up-front costs, no licensing fees and no royalities. The Raze Editor runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac, and includes a bunch of features that will make developing games a breeze.

This organisation was created to hold the source code for the engine, as well as samples, and documentation, giving you access to resources that will make the learning process much easier.
